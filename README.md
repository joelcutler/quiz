#Coding Quiz Challenge

This app is a timed, multiple-choice quiz on coding! If you answer a question incorrectly, the remaining time is deducted by 10 seconds. When you're finished with the questions, you remaining time becomes your high score. It is saved to local storage and can be displayed, along with past scores, upon request.
